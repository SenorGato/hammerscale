The primary components of a voxel engine typically include:

    Voxel data storage: This component is responsible for storing the voxel data that represents the geometry of the game world. The data is typically stored in a three-dimensional array, with each element of the array representing a single voxel.

    Mesh generation: This component is responsible for generating meshes from the voxel data. The meshes are used to render the game world and can be optimized for performance by combining adjacent voxels into larger blocks or using other techniques to reduce the number of individual vertices that need to be rendered.

    Physics simulation: This component is responsible for simulating the physical behavior of the voxel world, including collisions, gravity, and other forces. This allows players and objects to interact with the world in a realistic manner.

    Lighting and shading: This component is responsible for computing the lighting and shading of the voxel world, which can be complex due to the large number of voxels and the need to simulate indirect lighting and shadows.

    Procedural generation: This component is responsible for generating the voxel data that represents the game world. This can be done using a variety of techniques, such as noise functions or fractals, and allows for the creation of large, complex worlds that are unique in each playthrough.

    User interface: This component is responsible for presenting the game world to the player and allowing them to interact with it. This can include menus, controls, and other graphical elements that are used to control the game and display information to the player.
